I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with Thomas Lam.\nI completed my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, and spent a year in the Mathematics Master’s Program at the University of Bonn in Germany.\nBroadly, I am interested in algebraic combinatorics and its interactions with particle physics. I am currently thinking about positive geometries and the combinatorics of scattering amplitudes.\nI am grateful for the support of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.\nOffice: 4867 East Hall Email: bzacovic[at]umich[dot]edu"
