Hi! My name is Bailee Zacovic. I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with Thomas Lam. 

I completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, and spent a year at the University of Bonn in Germany. 

Broadly, I am interested in algebraic combinatorics and its interactions with particle physics. I am currently thinking about positive geometries and the combinatorics of scattering amplitudes.

I am grateful for the support of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
